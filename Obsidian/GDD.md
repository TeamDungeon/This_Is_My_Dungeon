# Pitch

A group of heroes have barged in your dungeon to steal your treasures ! Fight back with your fireballs and traps to stop them from getting to your treasure room. However, be careful ! The heroes are persistent and will keep coming back with new allies and new powers...
This is my Dungeon is a TPS/Tower Defense where the goal of the game is to protect your treasure room by placing down traps that will defeat the heroes trying to rob you.
The heroes know about your strength and will gradually get stronger over time, band together in bigger parties with different heroes each having their own abilities, and use new powers to clear your dungeon.
Don’t let them steal your treasure !
To defeat the heroes, you can attack them by your own using your mighty fireballs but you can also use your mana to place down traps or even upgrade then in order to stop the heroes.
